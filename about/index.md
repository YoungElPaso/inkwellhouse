Who’s this guy?
---
I’m a developer living with my family in Montreal, my home of 14 years.  I like to work on all sorts of web development projects although I’m best at doing things like JS, SASS, UI and UX on the frontend of things.  Currently I’m a Drupal dev at McGill university where I’ve been working for 3 years.  

I’m looking forward to learning more about Drupal and JavaScript, specifically NodeJS apps such as Yeoman, Grunt and Bower, as well as consistently working on my workflow.

Actually, I’m looking forward to coding in general. There’s always more to tinker with and work on.

Oh also, I used to have a rap centric radio show on Ckut and I prefer to use Linux for business and pleasure.

I’m also on the internet here:
google+, facebook, linkedin, etc...


This site is built using Grunt, Bower, Jekyll and GitHub Page, all of which I heartily recommend.
