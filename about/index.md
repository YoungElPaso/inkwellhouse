Who’s this guy?
---

I’m a developer living with my family in Montreal, my home of 14 years.  I like to work on all sorts of web development projects although I’m best at doing things like JS, SASS, UI and UX on the frontend.  Currently I’m a Drupal dev at McGill university where I’ve been working for 3 years.  

I’m looking forward to learning more about Drupal and JavaScript, specifically NodeJS apps such as Yeoman, <a href="http://www.gruntjs.com">Grunt</a> and Bower, as well as consistently working on my workflow.

Actually, I’m looking forward to coding in general. There’s always more to tinker with and work on.

Oh also, I used to have a rap centric radio show on Ckut and I prefer to use Linux for business and pleasure.
