Inkwell House was established in 2011 as a multidisciplinary cadre of artists from various backgrounds representing different techniques and schools of thought.  Our purpose is to excell in the creation of unparalleled beauty and sophistication. 

Inkwell House aims to provide skills and guidance for young artists in order to navigate through a political climate that has systematically reduced the importance of critical thought and flights of fancy by functioning as a modern sucessor to the medieval guild system.
